# Discover Music

A blueprint front-end VueJS application for the Capitol Innovation Labs hackathon.

It consumes data from the blueprint backend [Music Discovery Service](https://github.com/cloudinary-developers/music-discovery-service).

## Installation

Clone the repo. From within it’s directory, run:

```
npm install
```

If you’re on a Mac, you can host using a built-in HTTP server:

```
cd dist
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

(If you don’t have Python, or if you’re just feeling adventurous, try [`http-server`](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server))

You should now be able to see the app running at `http://localhost:8000`
